# Winder App
This is an task manager app that allows users to sign up an account and contribute to a pool of tasks. Users can assign tasks to other users, assign task priority, and change task statuses.

## Getting Started
Start by cloning the repository. Make sure that your current version of node is **v16.13.0** and make sure you are in the winder directory. Then run the following command.

``` npm install ```

Do this for the winder-backend directory as well.

Then start the local react server with:

``` npm start ```

The front-end will open to to localhost:3000.

To start the backend server go to the winder-backend directory and run:

``` npm start ```

The backend server will listen on localhost:8001 by default.
